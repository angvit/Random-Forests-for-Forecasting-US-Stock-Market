# Using Random Forests to Forecast US Stock Market

This project reproduces and evaluates the methodology described in the research paper ["The Random Forest Model for Analyzing and
Forecasting the US Stock Market in the Context of Smart
Finance"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17194), which uses technical indicators and machine learning models to predict stock price trends. The study focuses on forecasting whether stock prices will rise or fall over different trading horizons (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days).
